<h1> About EduCare</h1>

    <p> Across the United states, there are children that belong to families with a <a href="https://www.insightintodiversity.com/povertys-long-lasting-effects-on-students-education-and-success/" style="color: #893417;" target="_blank">household income of less than $25,000 a year.</a> Unfortunately, 51% of children from pre-K through 12th grade reside in low-income households.
    <br>
    <br>
Children growing up in poverty face many challenges not only at home, but in the classroom as well. Children living in poverty or low-income areas are subject to lower levels of academic performances that will follow them throughout their academic careers. These children lack the resources needed to receive quality education at their schools. Some students do not have the funds to receive textbooks, notebooks, writing utensils, and more. Because of this, low-income students are five times more likely to drop out of high school than those who are high income.
    <br>
    <br>
This is where EduCare comes in to help. Our company, EduCare, provides educational resources to lower income families to allow all students to get the quality education and career opportunities they deserve in order to build a successful steppingstone towards a bright future.
    <br>
    <br>
EduCare wants to provide additional resources for low-income and poverty-stricken families to ensure quality education to their children.
