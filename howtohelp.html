<h2>Tutoring</h2>
    
    <p>In order for students to be successful, they first need to be successful in the classroom. Students may face challenging courses and may not have the resources to get help or <a href="https://www.understood.org/en/articles/how-can-i-afford-a-tutor-for-my-child" target="_blank" style="color: #893417">tutoring.</a> Many schools are in need of more tutors for their students in the following areas:</p>
    
    <ul style="font-family: Verdana; padding-right: 100px; padding-left: 25px;">
    <li style="padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 100px;">Math</li>
    <li style="padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 100px;">English</li>
    <li style="padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 100px;">Science</li>
    <li style="padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 100px;">Foreign Languages &#40;Spanish &amp; English&#41;</li></ul> 
    <p>EduCare is always searching for high school and college students interested in tutoring to volunteer. By volunteering in tutoring in these subjects, EduCare is able to help students get ahead.</p>

<h2>EduCare Buddies</h2>
    
    
    
    <p>EduCare Buddies is a big brother/big sister program for low-income and poverty-stricken students. EduCare Buddies hang out with students at the EduCare facility 2 to 3 times a month for a few hours doing fun, everyday activities such as seeing a movie, doing homework, playing games, and going out to eat! With an EduCare Buddy in their life, low-income students are able to have that sense of empowerment as they work to earn better grades, grow their self-esteem, and even develop a friendship with their Buddy.
    <br>
        <br>
    EduCare Buddies consist of high school and college students who want to spend some extra time out of their day hanging out with some amazing students!</p>

<h2>Careers &amp; Internships</h2>
    
    <p>Low-income students are five times more likely to drop out of high school. In order to prevent this statistic, EduCare hosts career and internship fairs at local schools and at our facilities to help students prepare to enter their desired career field. With the help of local businesses and companies, EduCare has been able to provide internships for high school and college students, as well as full-time jobs to low-income students.
    <br>
    <br>
    EduCare welcomes all local businesses and companies, big and small. If you are a business or company looking for employees, please share your job opportunities with EduCare.
</p>

<h2>Donations</h2>
    <p>EduCare is always looking for donations and sponsorship opportunities to better help our students get the quality education they deserve. Donations as small as purchasing new books for students is enough. At EduCare, the opportunity to sponsor a low-income student is also an option. This would include donating school materials, books, clothes, and more to your sponsored student. Donations can also be made to schools such as providing classroom materials for teachers and students like tissues, markers, crayons, books, and more. </p>
